        <h4>Hello everyone, and welcome to my about me page.
            This will give you a bit of insight into what my life is about.
            Below you will find a small biography about me as well as a list of things
            that I enjoy doing.

        <p>
            I was born in a small town in the middle of nowhere called Lawrenceburg.
            If you haven't heard of it, you aren't alone in that aspect. The town has a population
            of about 30,000 people, and most are rather southern in the most pure sense.
            I'm talking confederate flags, horses and buggies, and even a drive your tractor to school day.
        </p>
        <p>
            I graduated high school from Lawrence County High in May of 2013 and shortly thereafter began school at <a href="https://tntech.edu">Tennessee Tech University.</a>
            Located in Cookeville, TN, <abbr title="Tennessee Technological University">TTU</abbr> has roughly 10,000 students.
            My time here was fun, and I was active in my fraternity throughout college.
        </p>
        <p>
            After graduating, I left Cookeville for Knoxville where I worked for Enterprise Rent-A-Car for a year or so until I left to begin a new chapter.
            I started with a company called <a href="https://teksystems.com">TEKsystems</a> on the 2<sup>nd</sup> of January, 2018.
            So far, I have enjoyed this, but I am ready to see what I can do from a programming perspective in my career.
